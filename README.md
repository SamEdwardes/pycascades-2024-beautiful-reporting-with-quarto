# pycascades-2024-beautiful-reporting-with-quarto

Code related to my 2024 PyCascades Lighting Talk.

# Talk outline

- Quarto is *"an open-source scientific and technical publishing system"*.
- It is similar to Jupyter Notebooks, put provides the ability to create many more types of outputs.
- You can choose to author your Quarto documents in `.qmd` or `.ipynb`.
- Why use Quarto?
  - Create beautiful outputs using a combination of Python and Markdown.
  - Create reproducible documents such as:
    - markdown files,
    - single page HTML files,
    - websites,
    - Word docs,
    - PDF docs,
    - HTML slides,
    - book formats,
    - and more.
- Today I want to show you how I use quarto to automate reporting.
- At work, I help maintain a Posit Connect application deployed into Kubernetes.
- With Quarto:
  - I write my analysis once. Thanks to code it is reprex.
  - I create visually appealing and interactive outputs.
